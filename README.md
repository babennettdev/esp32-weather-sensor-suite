# esp32-weather-sensor-suite

## DISCLAIMER
Unfortunately, I think I'm going to have to put this project on hold. I cannot access the webserver hosted by my ESP32. While I originally thought that was a bug in my code, I did a sanity check and uploaded a sample project (using the same ESPAsyncWebServer library) to my ESP32. It does not connect either. 

I believe this is an issue with my apartment's routers and the permissions set on them. I will confirm this when I have access to a home router. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn to use the Arduino IDE to write code for the ESP32. This project is also an attempt to familiarize myself with client/server interaction and HTML and CSS.

#### Sensors Used

  * DHT11 Temperature Sensor
  * Barometric Pressure Sensor
  * Photosensitive Sensor Module
